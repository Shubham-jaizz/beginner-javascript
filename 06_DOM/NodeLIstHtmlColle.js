// Html collection and NodeList is not an array because it doesn't contain map, reduce and filter prototype methods
// but we can convert it into array using Array.from() static method;


//innerText and textContent both differ by the property of textContent also shows the hidden content of the selected element


//setAttribute, getAttribute both are uset to get  set the attribute;
//we can select by className not class
